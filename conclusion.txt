what better way to summararize what ive learnt than uploading it on githib??
-make a file in your remote directory(ie your computer),then make a Repo on GitHub
-make changes on remote directory,then open it in vs code
-run commandf Git init
-git add remote origin "*link of your Repo*"
-git commit -m "message you want to write"
-git -u push "file name" or { .  } if you want to pushh everything
================================
wallah!!! repo is updated 

what if you wish to merge the two branches after you createe them??
GIT BRANCHING:
-git branches to see the branches 
-to make one,say git checkout -b "Name of branch"
-to shift between branches say. git checkout "name"
-git diff shows the changes made to the file in the branch u currently are 
-to merge to branches,say git merge ""Name"
-git branch -d "Name" to delete the branch you do not want
-lastly git logs to see all commits
